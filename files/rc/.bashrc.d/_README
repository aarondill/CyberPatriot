# Bashrc Directory

- Files here will be sourced by .bashrc
- Directories are sourced too!
- Files starting with an underscore '\_' will not be sourced
- Files are ordered using the following command:
  ```bash
  find ~/.bashrc.d/ -type f -not -name "_*" | sort
  ```
- NOTE: PATH and random environment variables should be set in .profile

## Moving files

Moving files here will not break the script, however
if files are moved, the line containing their path should
be changed to ensure files don't get lost

## Commenting

- Comments are highly suggested describing each file at the top
  and throughout to describe particularly cryptic operations
- Beginning with a \#! is suggested for syntax purposes
- Including a comment below the she-bang containing the desired
  path is recomendad to ensure the file is always in the correct
  location
